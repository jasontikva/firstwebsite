My name is Jason Tikva Owusu-Yeboah. I am a Ghanaian. I was 12 years old at the time I created the blog. I was born on 9<sup>th</sup> September 2009.
I attend school at Light of the World School Complex. I recommend it for all those who would like to send their wards to school in Ghana.
The school is from pre-school to grade 9. It is located at New Aplaku,
near Amalena Plaza. <a href="http://lightoftheworldschoolcomplex.com/" target="_blank">This is the school's website.</a>
